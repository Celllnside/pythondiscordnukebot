<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
This is a python bot for discord i made that will give you a list of non-reactors.
E.g: You use the bots command to send a message with a reaction, you can then wait however long you want and use the Finalize command to get a list of everyone who didnt react to the message before you Finalized. You can then use this list for whatever you want such as banning all the people who didnt react if its a small community and you are trying to keep it active.
